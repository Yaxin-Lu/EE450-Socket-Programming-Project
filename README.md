# EE450 Socket Programming Project
Simulation of a covid-19 tesing application process

This is the repository collects the code of 2020 Summer EE450 Socket Programming Project. The project is C/C++ based and aims to simulate a covid-19 tesing application process with TCP and UDP.

Project requirements:

In this project i will simulate a covid-19 tesing application process. This process involves the USC students who apply for covid-19 virus testing, the USC Health Center that manages the testing, and the different hospitals that will provide students the chances to get the test. The communication among the USC students, health center and hospitals are performed over TCP and UDP sockets in a network with a client-server architecture.

The project has 2 major phases: 1) Hospitals provide the USC health center, the list of available departments that could do the testing process, 2) Students apply to the USC center to have the chance of getting tested. The USC health center makes the decision and sends the results to both students and hospitals.

In phase 1 all communications are through TCP sockets.
In phase 2 the communication is through both TCP and UDP sockets.
